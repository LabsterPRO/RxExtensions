# RxExtensions

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/pro.labster/rxextensions/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/pro.labster/rxextensions)

RxExtensions is a library with different useful RxJava3 extensions.

## Requirements

- RxJava 3.x
- RxAndroid 3.x if you plan to use `AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()`

## Installation

Add dependency to your module's (usually `app/build.gradle`) `build.gradle` and sync:

```groovy
implementation 'pro.labster.rxextensions:(insert latest version)'
```

## Set up

No set up needed â€” just import the extensions or functions you need

## Schedulers extensions

Extensions helping to make `subscribeOn` and `observeOn` chains a bit shorter.

Extension name is `schedulers%subscribeOn%to%observeOn%`, for example `schedulersIoToMain` = `subscribe on Schedulers.io(), observe on AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()`.

Available extensions: 

- `schedulersIoToMain`
- `schedulersIoToSingle`
- `schedulersSingleToMain`
- `schedulersComputationToMain`

These extensions are available for:

- `Single`
- `Maybe`
- `Observable`
- `Flowable`
- `Completable`

## Emitters extensions

These extensions are useful for disposed-safe operations.

For example, you can use `ifNotDisposed` to execute a code block if not disposed:

```kotlin
Completable.create { emitter -> 
    // ...
    emitter.ifNotDisposed {
        // This block would be called only if not disposed
    }
}
```

There are also extensions for `onComplete`, `onError`, `onNext` etc methods.

Let's take `Observable` for example, it has 3 methods:

- `safeOnComplete`
- `safeOnNext`
- `safeOnError`

Usage examples:

```kotlin
Observable.create { emitter ->
    // ...
    
    if (/** condition **/) {
        emitter.safeOnNext(element) // Would be called only if not disposed
    }
    
    if (/** condition **/) {
        emitter.safeOnComplete() // Would be called only if not disposed
    }

    if (/** condition **/) {
        emitter.safeOnError(Throwable("SNAFU")) // Would be called only if not disposed
    }
}
```

These extensions are available for:

- `SingleEmitter`
  - `safeOnSuccess`
  - `safeOnError`
- `MaybeEmitter`
  - `safeOnSuccess`
  - `safeOnComplete`
  - `safeOnError`
- `ObservableEmitter`
  - `safeOnComplete`
  - `safeOnNext`
  - `safeOnError`
- `FlowableEmitter`
  - `safeOnComplete`
  - `safeOnNext`
  - `safeOnError`
- `CompletableEmitter`
  - `safeOnComplete`
  - `safeOnError`
  
## Misc

`maybeOfNullable` function accepts an object and returns `Maybe.just()` result if object is not `null` or `Maybe.empty` if it is

`Single.withMinTimeExecution` zips with a single and completes only after `interval` amount of time passed.

`Single.onErrorResumeNextIfInstance()` resumes with a result of a code block if error type is the given type, otherwise it'll propagate the initial throwable

Usage example:

```kotlin
Single
  .create { 
      // ...
  }
  .onErrorResumeNextIfInstance<IOException> {
      NetworkError()
  }
```
